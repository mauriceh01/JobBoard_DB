JOIN Companies c ON e.CompanyID = c.CompanyID
WHERE j.JobsStatus = 'Open'
ORDER BY j.PostedDate DESC;


-- 2. Show all skills required for a specific job (e.g., JobID = 1)

SELECT

FROM JobSkills js
JOIN Skills s ON js.SkillID = s.SkillID

JOIN Employers e ON e.UserID = u.UserID
JOIN Companies c ON e.CompanyID = c.CompanyID
GROUP BY u.UserID, c.CompanyName

FROM Jobs j
LEFT JOIN JobCategoryMapping jcm ON j.JobID = jcm.JobID

WHERE j.EmployerID = 1
GROUP BY j.JobID, j.JobsTitle, j.Location, j.PostedDate, j.SalaryRange;


-- 6. Show messages between two users (e.g., UserID 1 and UserID 3)

    m.ReceiverID,
    CONCAT(u2.FirstName, ' ', u2.LastName) AS ReceiverName,
    m.MessageBody,
    m.SentAt,
    m.IsRead
FROM Messages m
JOIN Users u1 ON m.SenderID = u1.UserID
JOIN Users u2 ON m.ReceiverID = u2.UserID
WHERE (m.SenderID = 1 AND m.ReceiverID = 3) 
   OR (m.SenderID = 3 AND m.ReceiverID = 1)
ORDER BY m.SentAt;


-- 7. List userâ€™s bookmarked jobs with job and company info (e.g., UserID = 2)

SELECT 
    b.BookmarkID,
    j.JobID,
    j.JobsTitle,
